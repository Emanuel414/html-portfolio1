<h2>Cats Dont Care</h2>
    <p>
      Cats dont care what dogs think.<br>
      They just look down and sorta wink.<br>
      Perch themseleves way up high.<br>
      The dog barks and starts to cry.<br>
      Its really not fair, those agile Cats.<br>
      Hiding in places just like rats.<br>
      The dog wants to play, join in the fun.<br>
      Chase that cat, make it run.<br>
      But cats care less, dont need to play fair.<br>
      Like to tease, dont have a care.<br>
      Poor dogs sits and wonders why?<br>
      Slyu old cat naps with a sigh.<br>
      Dog keeps gaurd, waiting for a twitch.<br>
      Cat doesnt move, not even an itch.<br>
      The game goes on, cat unaware.<br>
      The dog just pleads, please care.<br>
    </p>
